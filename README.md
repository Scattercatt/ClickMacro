# ClickMacro
Simple click macro program I wrote.

This program allows the user to record up to 20 mouse click inputs and set the time delay between each one. It also has pause functionality.

# Potential roadmap
    - Ability to save macros
    - Ability to add keyboard strokes
    - GUI potentially?
    - Right clicks
    - Any kind of inputs (?)
    - ???
